# BaseCinderApp example: Object Picker

Object Picker creates a Cinder gui with two cubes of different colors and displays Cinder settings widget.

The Cinder settings widget allows you to pick either of the two cubes and manipulate their color, size or rotation transformation.

Object Picker also introduces the Mouse Down event which translates the two cubes on click.
