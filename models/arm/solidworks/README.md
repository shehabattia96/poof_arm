## Assembly

The [joint coupling base](./joint%20coupling%20base.sldprt) has M3 holes spaced at 6mm intervals, with the last hole's center 7.250mm away from the edge. M3 screws can be used to add a [joint coupling](joint%20coupling.sldprt) to the center of the base, and four [wire guide at base](./wire%20guide%20at%20base.sldprt) parts along the edges to hold [v-pulley holders](./v-pulley%20holder.sldprt) with springs. The *v-pulley holders* guide the cables to the [drum housing](./drum%20housing.sldprt), which winds the cable. At each joint level, a *joint coupling base* can hold one or two *joint coupling* parts, as well as [wire guides](./wire%20guide.sldprt) to allow a 1mm cable to actuate the joint.
