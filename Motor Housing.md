# Ball and Socket - Motor housing

The motor housing is a rectangular enclosure for the two motors, two 6mm rods, four gears and four spools.

## Materials

The motor is a [GM4632-370 DC 24V 80RPM High torque Turbo Encoder Motor Worm Geared Motor Reducer Motor](https://www.banggood.com/GM4632-370-DC-24V-80RPM-High-torque-Turbo-Encoder-Motor-Worm-Geared-Motor-Reducer-Motor-p-1069462.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

The gears are [20 Degree Pressure Angle Plastic Gear, Round Bore, 0.5 Module, 60 Teeth](https://www.mcmaster.com/2662N32)

The rods are [Round Rod 6mm Diameter 200mm Length](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KT3J7NZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The bearings are [626-2RS Ball Bearing 6mm x 19mm x 6mm Double Sealed 180026 Deep Groove Bearings, Carbon Steel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FMPQP5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Dimensions

We're going to go with a 40mm x 90mm x 10mm (WxLxD) enclosure.

The motor uses M3 screws for its housing.

The gears' PD is 30mm, so that's the space we're going to position between the two gears.

The bearings are 19mm in diameter
